                    <h4>Where I've been and where I'm going</h4>
                    <!--This is the about me section with an h3 title and paragraph description-->
                    <p>After graduating from the University of South Florida with a Bachelor’s in Psychology, I worked
                        as a development officer for a national Non-profit. While I loved working out in the field and
                        networking with donors, I found my true passion creating web pages and applications.</p>
                    <p>As a student at Thinkful Academy, I’ve begun my journey to becoming a Software Developer, and I
                        couldn’t be happier.</p>
                    <p>If you are looking to hire a new developer with high passion and robust problem solving skills,
                        then feel free to contact me! I am excited to begin work to help you proudly display to the
                        world why your business is the best there is!</p>
